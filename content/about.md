I am sophomore at Smith College with a strong interest in the fields of Biology and Data Science. Long term, I am interested in working in the Biology field with a strong base in data analysis while also continuing to explore the intersection between the two fields. Currently, I am looking forward to using my summer to further gain experience in either field through an internship or similar opportunity. Presently, I work in a biology research lab at Smith College, and I have done a handful of data analysis mini-projects. Through those experiences, I know that I thrive in a collaborative team environment. 

Hugo is a static site engine written in Go.


It makes use of a variety of open source projects including:

* [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
* [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
* [J Walter Weatherman](https://github.com/spf13/jWalterWeatherman)
* [Cast](https://github.com/spf13/cast)

## Setup

Some fun facts about [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/):

* Built in [Go](http://golang.org/)
* Loosely inspired by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* Primarily developed by [spf13](http://spf13.com/) on the train while commuting to and from Manhattan.
* Coded in [Vim](http://vim.org) using [spf13-vim](http://vim.spf13.com/)
